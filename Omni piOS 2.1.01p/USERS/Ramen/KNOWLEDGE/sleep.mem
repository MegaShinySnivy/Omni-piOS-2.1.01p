Sleeping is our brain resting, because it knows it can't handle too much of "reality". Why do you think you can play games instead of sleep? because both are an escape from
"reality". Sleeping can also allow our meat bag bodies to regenerate a little bit, even though we're all slowly decaying as the endless march of time counts down to the day
of our death.
