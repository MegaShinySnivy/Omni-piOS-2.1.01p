-TIME IS A HUMAN CONSTRUCT THAT OUR MINDS CREATED BECAUSE WE CAN ONLY EXPERIENCE SO MUCH INFORMATION AT ONCE, BY TIME "EXISTING" OUR BRAINS HAVE TO WORK LESS HARD. WHY DOES TIME FLY WHEN WE'RE HAVING FUN? WE HAVE TO DO LESS MENTAL WORK. TIME ISN'T REAL, BUT ONLY A FIGMENT OF OUR COLLECTIVE IMAGINATION THAT OUR CONSIOUSNESS PROCESSES AS A MEASURABLE THING. WELCOME TO REALITY, WHICH DOESN'T EVEN EXIST.```
